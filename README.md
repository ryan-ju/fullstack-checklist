# Overview

A checklist of tech considerations when building fullstack with [SRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering) in mind.


# Frontend

* Language: [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).  Full stop.  
* Frameworks: [Reace >= 0.14]() with [functional components](https://hackernoon.com/react-stateless-functional-components-nine-wins-you-might-have-overlooked-997b0d933dbc) and 
* Shared common library.  [bit.dev](https://bit.dev/) has very good UI and might be easier than [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna).
* Avoid 1 git repo per module.  It doesn't scale.
